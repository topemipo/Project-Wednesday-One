# Project Wednesday: Predictive Analysis for Music Genre Classification

**<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning</h1>**

For the people that might need a little more help - Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Liv6eeb1VfE) or this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi0vhXFPegw) for a beginner's introduction to EDA. They both contain explanations to most of the functions I used in my own attempt. ChatGPT or any other LLM is also very helpful here but remember, don't just copy and paste without understanding how the code works and how you can write it on your own without any help next time.

Here are the steps you should take for this section :
1. Import your dataset 
2. Check for null values
3. If there are any null values, clear them out. Ensure that they are all gone.
4. Investigate the datatypes contained in the dataset with `info()` and check for the unique genres in the dataset with `value_counts()`
5. Visualize the distribution of Genres unique values

You can always check my attempt of this project on Github if you're not sure of anything.
